# GIS in Government

GIS is integral in the operations of many sectors in government, including Elections, Emergency Management, Human Services, Humanitarian Assistance,  Land Administration and Land Records, Law Enforcement, Land Surveying, Maritime and Hydrography Surveying, Official Statistics, Public Health, and Transportation.

### Elections

Geography is the common denominator of where voters live, how residents engage in the voting process, and how officials manage elections.&#x20;

Modern elections departments embrace GIS technology to:

* Streamline election preparations.
* Support Election Day activities.
* Increase voter outreach and education.
* Deliver user-friendly election results applications.

Take a look at what we can do for your election with the city's suite of ESRI products:

### Land Administration & Land Records

The three necessary systems in land administration are the system of record (land parcels), the system of insight (valuation), and the system of engagement (stakeholder and public engagement). GIS offers a single, comprehensive platform to manage all three aspects, improving land information management, property valuation and analysis, and communication with the public.
