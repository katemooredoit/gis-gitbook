# What is GIS?

GIS, or a Geographic Information System, is a type of data management network which spans every department in the city. Our GIS system allows us to use a map as a platform for storing information and running location-intelligent analyses. A GIS system performs four core functions within any organization to achieve the common goal of gaining actionable intelligence from all types of data.

### Create

### Analyze

### Manage
